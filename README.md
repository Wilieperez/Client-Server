# Client-Server

The following files include a client server program in C which simulates petitions to recieve data from "sensors". The data is obtained from a json file

First you have to run the makefile using "make"

next you have to run the server using "./server"

after that you can run up to 5 clients at a time using "./client"

from there the client command will ask for the sensor and the axis from which you'd like to receive information
